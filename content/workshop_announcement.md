# Workshop announcement

üìÖ **Date**: August 18 - August 21, 2025 <br>
üìç **Location**: Colorado State University <br>
üîó **Registration opening soon**

The **AI Foundation Models for the Atmosphere** workshop will to bring together atmospheric scientists and model developers to explore emerging applications of AI foundation models for the atmosphere.

AI foundation models (FMs), i.e., large machine learning models trained on large, generic corpora of atmospheric training data, have emerged during recent years as a novel tool to approach challenging tasks in atmospheric science. This workshop aims to bring together atmospheric scientists and model developers to assess the current state-of-the-art of AI FMs and related validation frameworks, explore their applications, and identify potential data, technology, and knowledge gaps hindering their adoption.


## Main program points:

Presentation and discussion sessions on the development of AI FMs and their application throughout the Atmospheric Sciences
Hands-on sessions on using current FMs on diverse tasks such satellite retrievals, weather forecasting, and climate model downscaling.
Roadmap Development: Collaboratively outlining key opportunities, challenges, and strategic steps needed to unlock the full potential of FMs in atmospheric science.

The findings and discussions from this workshop will form the basis of a report detailing the principal opportunities and challenges, and offering a strategic roadmap for advancing the use of AI FMs in atmospheric science.

Please mark your calendars for this exciting event! We will provide further details, including the full agenda and registration information, in early March.

We look forward to your participation.
