The AI Foundation Models for the Atmosphere workshop will to bring together atmospheric scientists and model developers to explore emerging applications of AI foundation models for the atmosphere.
AI foundation models (FMs), i.e., large machine learning models trained on large, generic corpora of atmospheric training data, have emerged during recent years as a novel tool to approach challenging tasks in atmospheric science. This workshop aims to bring together atmospheric scientists and model developers to assess the current state-of-the-art of AI FMs and related validation frameworks, explore their applications, and identify potential data, technology, and knowledge gaps hindering their adoption.">
