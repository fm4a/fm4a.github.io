    AI foundation models (FMs), i.e., large machine learning models trained on
    extensive, generic corpora of atmospheric training data, have emerged as a
    novel tool to approach challenging tasks in atmospheric science. The <b>AI
    Foundation Models for the Atmosphere workshop</b> will bring together
    atmospheric scientists and model developers to assess the current
    state of the art of AI FMs and related validation frameworks, explore their
    applications, and identify remaining data, technology, and knowledge gaps
    hindering their adoption.

    <h3>Program points</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> Presentation and discussion sessions on the development of AI FMs and their application throughout the Atmospheric Sciences </li>
        <li> Hands-on sessions demonstrating the use of FMs on diverse tasks ranging from satellite retrievals over weather forecasting to climate model downscaling. </li>
        <li> Roadmap Development: Collaboratively outlining key opportunities, challenges, and strategic steps needed to unlock the full potential of FMs in atmospheric science. </li>
      </ul>

    The findings and discussions from this workshop will form the basis for a
    report detailing principal opportunities and challenges of FMs for
    atmospheric-science applications, and proposing a roadmap for advancing the
    use of AI FMs in atmospheric science.
    </p>


    <h3>Audience</h3>

    We welcome  graduate students, postdocs, faculty, research scientists interested in developing atmospheric-science applications of AI FMs as well as model developers that want to share their models with the atmospheric science community.
