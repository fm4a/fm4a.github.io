    AI foundation models (FMs), i.e., large machine learning models trained on
    extensive, generic corpora of atmospheric training data, are emerging as
    powerful tools for tackling complex challenges in atmospheric science. The
    <b>AI Foundation Models for the Atmosphere workshop</b> will bring together
    atmospheric scientists and model developers to assess the current state of
    the art of AI FMs and related validation frameworks, explore their
    applications, and identify remaining data, technology, and knowledge gaps
    hindering their adoption.

    <h3>Program Highlights</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> Presentation and discussion sessions on the development of AI FMs and their application throughout the Atmospheric Sciences </li>
        <li> Hands-on sessions demonstrating the use of FMs on diverse tasks ranging from satellite retrievals over weather forecasting to climate model downscaling. </li>
        <li> Roadmap Development: Collaboratively outlining key opportunities, challenges, and strategic steps needed to unlock the full potential of FMs in atmospheric science. </li>
      </ul>

    The findings and discussions from this workshop will form the basis for a
    report detailing principal opportunities and challenges of FMs for
    atmospheric-science applications, and proposing a roadmap for advancing the
    use of AI FMs in atmospheric science.
    </p>


    <h3>Target Audience</h3>

    <p>
        We invite <strong>graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and research scientists</strong> interested in developing AI FM applications for atmospheric science.
        <strong>AI model developers</strong> eager to share their models and collaborate with the atmospheric science community are also highly encouraged to participate.
